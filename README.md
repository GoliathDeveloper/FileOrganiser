FileOrganiser
=============

File Organiser v1.0
I Designed this as my downloads folder was getting out of control
in the target folder it will organise all files into different folders,
seperating all files out so they can be easily sorted.

\Documents will contain (txt|docx|doc|pdf|chm)
\Dlls i think this is pretty self explanatory
\Installers will contain (exe|msi),
\Mac will contain (dmg|pkg|dpkg),
\Images will contain (jpg|bmp|png|gif|tiff|psd|xcf), 
\Folders will contain all subfolders
\SpreadSheets will contain 
\Archives will contain (zip|rar|tar.gz|tgz)
\Html will contain (html|htm)
\Torrent :)
